# Barbarita remindme

This is a humble homenage to my mother, she every day kindly remind me to read at least a versicule of the Bible.

She is a Jehova Witnes and my Rock. So I Love You Mum!!!

## Note

I also wanted to practice my Nodejs doing a CLI so that's it if you want to use it just:

To print a message in the console
`barabarita --showme`

and just `barabarita` to see a webpage.
